<p>CSC 3600 - ICT Professional Project<br />
Semester 1 - 2022</p>

<h1 id="project-description">Project Description</h1>
<div class="flushleft">
<p>To improve profitability, Queensland persimmon producers and
Persimmons Australia Inc have identified a need to drive digital
transformation in their businesses. Conceptualised by producers, the
Persimmon Weekly Market Report is fostering digital transformation
across the industry and is set to become an essential business decision
making tool leading a more market focussed and profitable industry.</p>
<p>The Persimmon Weekly Market Report is a persimmon specific digital
reporting system to inform and direct producers’ activities around
supply to market, packaging and price negotiations thereby allowing them
to grow new and existing domestic market opportunities, increase their
responsiveness to future market disruptions and improve their
resilience.</p>
<p>In 2021, in collaboration with the University of Southern Queensland,
an online data entry portal was created for data collection. This
created an efficient and cost‐effective cloud‐based data exchange system
for analysis. The Data Entry Portal is being rolled out across the
industry this season.</p>
<p>The growers have suggested that there could be advantages of having
an app developed for a standalone click through data entry process. The
app may also offer opportunities to deliver reports and infographics
from the data analysis process directly to the end user.</p>
<p>The level of engagement displayed by producers clearly demonstrates
their willingness to drive digital transformation in their businesses
and adopt and integrate the Persimmon Weekly Market Report as a critical
business decision making tool.</p>
<p>The development of an app would further refine the process of data
collection, analysis and reporting in transitioning to a cloud‐based
data exchange system. Expected Outcome:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A dedicated app for data entry and report delivery for the
Persimmon Weekly Market Report program.</p></li>
<li><p>A sustainable and a cost‐effective end‐to‐end digital
solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Digital interfaces which are user‐friendly and useful for
persimmon producers.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased confidence and use of digital technology across the
industry.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Queensland persimmon producers are well placed to maximise the
benefits from an app as their fruit is the first to enter the Australian
market each season in late February‐early March due to the varieties
grown and seasonal conditions, thus providing a strong incentive for
adoption.</p>
<p>Additionally, as the only persimmon suppliers in the domestic market
for several weeks, Queensland producers could have greater control over
increasing returns and profitability. Similar opportunities exist for
exporting, where Queensland persimmons have a unique supply window with
little to no competition in key markets throughout Asia.</p>

<h1 id="project-management-reflection">Project Management
Reflection</h1>
<div class="flushleft">
<p>The management of the project was shared;<br />
Each member of the team was aware of the project expectations.</p>
<p>The approach taken to producing the plan was discussed and roles for
each part of it were distributed among us.</p>
<p>From the lectures it seemed implied that we were able to apply a
mixture of project management strategies and I think we did do that
quite well.</p>
<p>Exploring what worked for our situation was important as students
taking on a project as a group. Being a group that had never worked
together, met one another, or taken on a group project in a professional
setting</p>
<p>The project plan and it’s required sections was something that took a
lot more time to construct as it was more like finding details to fill
the sections, rather than simply having those details to list. So, in
that respect it was more challenging that an actual project would need
to be for an established business.</p>
<p>The idea of phases forced us to think about how the project would be
developed, and made us realise what needed to go into the development
.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="teamwork-reflection">Teamwork Reflection</h1>
<div class="flushleft">
<p>This project was completed entirely remotely, we didn’t once meet up,
yet the tasks that suited collaboration went quite well via MS Teams. At
least once a week we would schedule a meeting and the times for those
meetings were confirmed to be acceptable by all members.</p>
<p>The meetings we had helped us organise tasks and schedule times to
complete them by. I took some time over the break to attempt to make a
prototype, consisting of just the data entry page and linking the form
from it to a database, hosted on a NAS.</p>
<p>After demonstrating the way it functioned with a short screen
captured video Joshua went ahead and did some research on how we could
use azure, which falls under the Technology Reflection section, but the
teamwork side of that was how he passed on what he had researched to the
team and explained in a Teams call how to replicate his settings.</p>
<p>I think that was the point from on which we worked most effectively
as a team on the actual development of the project.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="technology-reflection">Technology Reflection</h1>
<div class="flushleft">
<p>The technology used by our team in this project was amazingly useful
for us,<br />
all working remotely.<br />
I personally hadn’t used MS Teams, but it was acceptably
intuitive,<br />
I did develop a grudge on Microsoft a little bit for some of the layout
choices and positioning of certain options, but that was just until I
became more familiar with it.</p>
<p>Azure is really useful, initially though it was overwhelming to use
due to the abundance of tools available combined with the use of glyphs
without labels and then even when they do have a label, it’s as if they
had specific instructions to not be intuitively understandable.</p>
<p>Our requirement was just an SQL server and to host the site, there
must be about ten different ways one could accomplishing that on azure
and not until exploring them would anyone know which suits them or which
is available to their location or account type. There were changes that
affected the layout to make it vary from examples shown in tutorials,
but I became familiar with it with time.</p>
<p>Visual Studio was used, and I found that simple enough to operate in,
and especially found the way we used git very helpful in being able to
collaborate in the project’s development.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="culture-awareness-reflection">Culture Awareness Reflection</h1>
<div class="flushleft">
<p>This was an interesting aspect, there were very subtle differences in
our backgrounds and our situations but I think I realised that actually
cultural similarities rather than differences should be things to be
aware of in a team setting, when the majority of the team share for
example the experience of completing the agile course, that brings to
the team a very important cultural similarity.</p>
<p>In that we all are aware of much of the same things that go into a
project. The importance of communicating, what goes into risk analysis,
the benefits of doing things certain ways were subjects we didn’t seem
to need to go into detail about or discuss much.</p>
<p>The most important thing I learned from this project combined with
the Agile Methods course was that a group being equally aware of the
same things, having matching comprehension of details that aren’t
obvious, that most professionals had to work decades before realising
and formulating ways to implement.</p>
<p>All of us having that experience as a shared cultural background was
and is a very beneficial quality of our team and I think the entire ICT
industry.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="professional-code-of-conduct-and-ethic-reflection">Professional
Code of Conduct and Ethic Reflection</h1>
<div class="flushleft">
<p>Again, with a shared understanding of industry based ethical
standards for ICT, and the understanding of the importance of respecting
and upholding them.</p>
<p>With honesty, legal compliance, competence and diligence,
confidentiality, professional development, and integrity being the
backbone of how we operated.</p>
<p>It didn’t need a lot of attention, any time a subject that came up in
discussion that could potentially invade privacy or threaten to go
against the teams ethical standards we all acknowledged how best to go
about it ethically, for example discussing with the client their
existing user details, we were very upfront about details that we wanted
while reminding them that we didn’t want or need any information more
than necessary to providing their required features.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<div class="flushleft">
<p>I enjoyed this project very much, it was a fulfilling challenge that
has made me realise the value of my communication skills, creativity,
and technical ability.</p>
<p>I’m proud to have been able to contribute to this project and am
satisfied with the process and the product of its development.</p>
<p>We produced something I think exceeds the initial goals of the
project.<br />
That could easily be implemented to the benefit of persimmon growers
associated with Persimmons Australia.</p>
